The site lets you surf music while listening to it,and can also be downloaded.But due to api issues,this is just a prototype.You can type in the music and for now it lets you listen 30 seconds of that audio.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
It was always a problem for a free open-source music streaming and downloading app to be found completely ad-free.The access toke gets expired after 1 hour.
